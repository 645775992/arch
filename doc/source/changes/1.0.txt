Changes since 1.0
-----------------

- Refactored to move the univariate routines to `arch.univariate` and added
  deprecation warnings in the old locations
- Enable `numba` jit compilation in the python recursions
- Added a boostrap framework, which will be used in future versions.
  The boostrap framework is general purpose and can be used via high-level
  functions such as `conf_int` or `cov`, or as a low level iterator using
  `bootstrap`
