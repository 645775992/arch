Changes since 4.0
=================
- Added ``FixedVariance`` volatility process which allows pre-specified variances to be used with
  a mean model.  This has been added to allow so-called zig-zag estimation where a mean model is
  estimated with a fixed variance, and then a variance model is estimated on the residuals using
  a ``ZeroMean`` variance process.
