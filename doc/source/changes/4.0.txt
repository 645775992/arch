Changes since 4.0
=================
- Fixed a bug in ``ADF`` when applying to very short time series
  (:issue:`262`).
- Added ability to set the ``random_state`` when initializing a bootstrap
  (:issue:`259`).
- Added support for Fractionally Integrated GARCH (FIGARCH)
- Enable user to specify a specific value of the `backcast` in place of
  the automatically generated value.
- Fixed a big where parameter-less models where incorrectly reported as
  having constant variance (:issue:`248`)
- Added support for MIDAS volatility processes using Hyperbolic
  weighting (:issue:`233`)
- Added a parameter to forecast that allows a user-provided callable random
  generator to be used in place of the model random generator. (:issue:`225`)
- Added a low memory automatic lag selection method that can be used with very
  large time-series.
- Improved performance of automatic lag selection in ADF and related tests.
- Added named parameters to Dickey-Fuller regressions.
- Removed use of the module-level NumPy RandomState. All random number
  generators use separate RandomState instances.
- Fixed a bug that prevented 1-step forecasts with exogenous regressors
- Added the Generalized Error Distribution for univariate ARCH models
- Fixed a bug in MCS when using the max method that prevented all included
  models from being listed
- Added ``FixedVariance`` volatility process which allows pre-specified
  variances to be used with a mean model.  This has been added to allow
  so-called zig-zag estimation where a mean model is estimated with a fixed
  variance, and then a variance model is estimated on the residuals using
  a ``ZeroMean`` variance process.
- Fixed a bug that prevented ``fix`` from being used with a new model
  (:issue:`156`)
- Added ``first_obs`` and ``last_obs`` parameters to ``fix`` to mimic ``fit``
- Added ability to jointly estimate smoothing parameter in EWMA variance when
  fitting the model
- Added ability to pass optimization options to ARCH model estimation
  (:issue:`195`)
