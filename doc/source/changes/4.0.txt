Release 4.8
===========
- Added Zivot-Andrews unit root test :class:`~arch.unitroot.ZivotAndrews`.
  This code was originally written by Jim Varanelli.
- Added data dependent lag length selection to the KPSS test,
  :class:`~arch.unitroot.KPSS`. This code was originally written by
  Jim Varanelli.
- Added :class:`~arch.bootstrap.IndependentSamplesBootstrap` to
  perform bootstrap inference on statistics from independent samples that may
  have uneven length (:issue:`260`).
- Added :func:`~arch.univariate.base.ARCHModelResult.arch_lm_test` to
  perform ARCH-LM tests on model residuals or standardized residuals
  (:issue:`261`).
- Fixed a bug in :class:`~arch.unitroot.ADF` when applying to very short time series
  (:issue:`262`).
- Added ability to set the ``random_state`` when initializing a bootstrap
  (:issue:`259`).

Release 4.7
===========
- Added support for Fractionally Integrated GARCH (FIGARCH) in
  :class:`~arch.univariate.FIGARCH`.
- Enable user to specify a specific value of the `backcast` in place of
  the automatically generated value.
- Fixed a big where parameter-less models where incorrectly reported as
  having constant variance (:issue:`248`).


Release 4.6
===========
- Added support for MIDAS volatility processes using Hyperbolic
  weighting in :class:`~arch.univariate.MidasHyperbolic`
  (:issue:`233`).

Release 4.5
===========
- Added a parameter to forecast that allows a user-provided callable random
  generator to be used in place of the model random generator (:issue:`225`).
- Added a low memory automatic lag selection method that can be used with very
  large time-series.
- Improved performance of automatic lag selection in ADF and related tests.

Release 4.4
===========
- Added named parameters to Dickey-Fuller regressions.
- Removed use of the module-level NumPy RandomState. All random number
  generators use separate RandomState instances.
- Fixed a bug that prevented 1-step forecasts with exogenous regressors.
- Added the Generalized Error Distribution for univariate ARCH models.
- Fixed a bug in MCS when using the max method that prevented all included
  models from being listed.

Release 4.3
===========
- Added :class:`~arch.univariate.FixedVariance` volatility process which
  allows pre-specified variances to be used with a mean model.  This has been
  added to allow so-called zig-zag estimation where a mean model is estimated
  with a fixed variance, and then a variance model is estimated on the residuals
  using a ``ZeroMean`` variance process.

Release 4.2
===========
- Fixed a bug that prevented ``fix`` from being used with a new model
  (:issue:`156`).
- Added ``first_obs`` and ``last_obs`` parameters to ``fix`` to mimic ``fit``.
- Added ability to jointly estimate smoothing parameter in EWMA variance when
  fitting the model.
- Added ability to pass optimization options to ARCH model estimation
  (:issue:`195`).
